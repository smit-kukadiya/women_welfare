# women_welfare
Government of Gujarat has implemented many welfare schemes for women in the State. In addition, there are many schemes for women and children welfare, but all schemes and their websites are different, so users need to find each scheme individually. Hence, there are many websites that provides women-related Schemes, but the user cannot understand the website well and the required information is not available for user and little bit of complicated that’s why users can’t interact with those websites.
